This is a web installer for [Silent Hill 2: Enhanced Edition](http://www.enhanced.townofsilenthill.com/SH2/), originally created for learning purposes only, and later becoming an actual component of the project.

The source code is here for archival and reference purposes.

If you actually want to install SH2EE using this installer, download an official release from the SH2EE website instead.
