This is a prototype installer for [SH2EE](http://www.enhanced.townofsilenthill.com/SH2/), originally created for learning purposes only, and uploaded here for archival and future reference.

Its current design uses hardcoded links and paths for the installation, so it will most likely not work as-is. If you actually want to install SH2EE, check their official website instead.
